## Stack

A stack is an abstract data type data structure with two major opertaions, namely `push` and `pop`.

Common operations:
- `push` - adds an element to the stack.
- `pop` - removes an element from the top.
- `peek` - returns the top element in the stack.
- `isEmpty` - returns true if stack is empty else false.
- `size` - returns the total number of elements in the stack, which is the size.

Extra operations:
- `duplicate` - copy the top item and push it back to the stack.
- `swap` - swap the 2 topmost items in the stack.
- `rotate` - move the topmost elements in the stack 'rotation' times to the right.
