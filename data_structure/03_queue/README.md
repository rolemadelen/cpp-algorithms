## Queue

A queue is an abstract data type data structure with two major operations, namely `enqueue` and `dequeue`.

The order of how elements are added and removed from the queue is based on the FIFO (First-In First-Out) principle.

### Common Operations
- `enqueue` - adds an element to the queue.
- `dequeue` - removes an element from the queue.
- `front` - returns the first element in the queue.
- `isEmpty` - returns true if queue is empty else false.
- `size` - returns the total number of elements in the queue, which is the size.

### Extra Operations:
- `rotate(n)` - move the first elements in the queue `n` times to the right.
